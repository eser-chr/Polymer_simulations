#Polymer_sims


This code was used during a project at IMBA (Vienna).

The main idea is to show that DNA can be simulated with DPD instead of the traditional Langevin dynamics.

To show the above statement I performed multiple simulations using hoomd and create one major metric.

1) Correlation of Rouse modes

In addition, I ensured that other metrics are similar, such as:
-Radius of gyration
-Diffusion (although it is known that Langevin dynamics do not reproduce correctly the diffusion coefficient).
